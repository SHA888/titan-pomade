# Overview  
Titan Pomade is a modern, full-stack web application template designed to accelerate development of scalable and maintainable web applications. It provides a production-ready foundation with best practices, modern tooling, and a well-architected codebase.

**Problem it solves:** Developers often spend significant time setting up project infrastructure, configuring tools, and implementing common features. Titan Pomade eliminates this overhead.

**Target Users:**
- Startup developers needing a quick start
- Full-stack developers building modern web apps
- Teams requiring consistent architecture

**Value Proposition:**
- 80% reduction in initial setup time
- Built-in best practices and security
- Scalable architecture from day one
- Comprehensive documentation

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk:** Complex state management in Next.js
  - *Mitigation:* Start with React Context, move to Zustand if needed

- **Risk:** Database performance at scale
  - *Mitigation:* Implement indexing, query optimization, and caching

## MVP Scope
- **Risk:** Scope creep
  - *Mitigation:* Strictly define MVP features and defer enhancements

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk:** Limited development resources
  - *Mitigation:* Prioritize must-have features, use existing solutions when possible

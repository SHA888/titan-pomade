# TypeScript Error Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve TypeScript errors in the Titan Pomade project.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. FormField Type Extension
**Files**: 
- `apps/web/src/components/forms/crud-form.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/forms/optimistic-crud-form.tsx`

**Issue**: The FormField type didn't support 'checkbox' as a valid input type, causing type errors when using checkbox fields.

**Fix**: Extended the FormField type to include 'checkbox' and implemented the rendering logic for checkbox inputs.

### 2. Missing UI Component
**Files**: 
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`

**Issue**: The component was trying to import `@radix-ui/react-dialog` which wasn't installed.

**Fix**: Installed the missing dependency using pnpm.

### 3. Skeleton Import Issue
**Files**: 
- `apps/web/src/components/common/data-table.tsx`

**Issue**: The DataTable component was trying to import a non-existent Skeleton component.

**Fix**: Replaced the Skeleton import with a simple div element that has the same visual effect.

### 4. Undefined Variable in Hook
**Files**: 
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-optimistic-crud.ts`

**Issue**: The `originalItem` and `itemIndex` variables were not accessible in the rollback function scope.

**Fix**: Used a ref to store the deleted item information and access it during rollback.

### 5. DataTable Component Enhancement
**Files**: 
- `apps/web/src/components/common/data-table.tsx`

**Issue**: The DataTable component didn't support additional features like row click handlers and custom actions.

**Fix**: Extended the DataTableProps interface and implemented the new features.

### 6. Type Issues in Pages
**Files**: 
- `apps/web/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/products/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/forms/crud-example.tsx`

**Issue**: Various type mismatches and missing type annotations.

**Fix**: Added proper type annotations and fixed syntax errors.

## Verification

All TypeScript errors in the web project have been resolved. The web project now passes type checking successfully.

The API project has unrelated type issues with the date-fns library that would need separate attention.
